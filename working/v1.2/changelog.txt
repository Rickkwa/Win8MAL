Version 1.2
===========
May 22, 2013
- both row's tiles are aligned with each other (before, there was 1px offset for the left division)
	- increased the width of list_surround and the controlbar to 1008px
	- set the td and <a> of the filter tiles to 160px



Version 1.1
===========
May 20, 2013
- Changed the listinfo_icon, links_icon, otherlinks_icon pictures because the old ones were too jagged/not smooth
- Fixed a bug where the otherlinks tile text overlaps the icon
	- moved all the icons 10px to the right (so now background: url(...) no-repeat 260px center)
	- restricted the width of the divs in otherlinks
- removed the padding from the links in controlbar, and replaced it with padding-left on the divs in controlbar (and the two links on the right in links tile)


Version 1.0
===========
May 20, 2013
