Version 1.1
===========
May 20, 2013
- Changed the listinfo_icon, links_icon, otherlinks_icon pictures because the old ones were too jagged/not smooth
- Fixed a bug where the otherlinks tile text overlaps the icon
	- moved all the icons 10px to the right (so now background: url(...) no-repeat 260px center)
	- restricted the width of the divs in otherlinks
- removed the padding from the links in controlbar, and replaced it with padding-left on the divs in controlbar (and the two links on the right in links tile)
